# Grocery-guard
" The Grocery Guard is a device that helps minimize food waste, saves money spent on food, and keeps meals interesting! 
The Grocery Guard can be attached to a refrigerator and keeps track of the items inside, along with their expiration dates, 
with the use of a barcode scanner and suggest recipes."
